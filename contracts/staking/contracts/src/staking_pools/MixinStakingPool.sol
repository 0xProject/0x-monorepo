    /// @dev This mixin contains logic for staking pools.
    /// A pool has a single operator and any number of delegators (members).
    /// Any staker can create a pool, although at present it is only beneficial
    /// for market makers to create staking pools. A market maker *must* create a
    /// pool in order to receive fee-based rewards at the end of each epoch (see MixinExchangeFees).
    /// Moreover, creating a staking pool leverages the delegated stake within the pool,
    /// which is counted towards a maker's total stake when computing rewards. A market maker
    /// can register any number of makerAddresses with their pool, and can incentivize delegators
    /// to join their pool by specifying a fixed percentage of their fee-based rewards to be split amonst
    /// the members of their pool. Any rewards set aside for members of the pool is divided based on
    /// how much stake each member delegated.
    ///
    /// Terminology:
    /// "Pool Id"       - A unique id generated by this contract and assigned to each pool when it is created.
    /// "Pool Operator" - The creator and operator of the pool.
    /// "Pool Members"  - Members of the pool who opted-in by delegating to the pool.
    /// "Market Makers" - Market makers on the 0x protocol.
    ///
    /// How-To for Market Makers:
    /// 1. Create a pool, specifying what percentage of rewards kept for yourself.
    ///     The remaining is divided among members of your pool.
    /// 2. Add the addresses that you use to market make on 0x.
    /// 3. Leverage the staking power of others by convincing them to delegate to your pool.
