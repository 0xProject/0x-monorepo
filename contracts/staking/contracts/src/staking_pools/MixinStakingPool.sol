/// @dev This mixin contains logic for staking pools.
/// A pool has a single operator and any number of delegators (members).
/// Any staker can create a pool, although at present it is only beneficial
/// for market makers to create staking pools. A market maker *must* create a
/// pool in order to receive fee-based rewards at the end of each epoch (see MixinExchangeFees).
/// Moreover, creating a staking pool leverages the delegated stake within the pool,
/// which is counted towards a maker's total stake when computing rewards. A market maker
/// can register any number of makerAddresses with their pool, and can incentivize delegators
/// to join their pool by specifying a fixed percentage of their fee-based rewards to be split amonst
/// the members of their pool. Any rewards set aside for members of the pool is divided based on
/// how much stake each member delegated.
///
/// Terminology:
/// "Pool Id"       - A unique id generated by this contract and assigned to each pool when it is created.
/// "Pool Operator" - The creator and operator of the pool.
/// "Pool Members"  - Members of the pool who opted-in by delegating to the pool.
/// "Market Makers" - Market makers on the 0x protocol.
///
/// How-To for Market Makers:
/// 1. Create a pool, specifying what percentage of rewards kept for yourself.
///     The remaining is divided among members of your pool.
/// 2. Add the addresses that you use to market make on 0x.
/// 3. Leverage the staking power of others by convincing them to delegate to your pool.
