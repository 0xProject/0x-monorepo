/// @dev This mixin contains logic for timeLocking stake.
/// **** Read MixinStake before continuing ****
/// When stake moves from an Activated state it must first go to
/// the Deactivated & TimeLocked state. The stake will be timeLocked
/// for a period of time, called a TimeLock Period, which is measured in epochs.
/// (see MixinScheduler).
/// Stake remains timeLocked for at least one full TimeLock Period; so,
/// if your stake is locked sometime during TimeLock Period #1 then it will
/// be un-TimeLocked at TimeLock Period #3.
/// Note that no action is required by the user to un-TimeLock their stake, and
/// when stake is un-TimeLocked it is moved to the state Deactivated & Withdrawable.
/// (see MixinStake).
///
/// -- The TimeLocking Data Structure --
/// Three fields are used to represent a timeLock:
///     1. Total timeLocked stake (called `total`)
///     2. TimeLocked stake pending removal of timeLock, on next TimeLock Period (called `pending`)
///     3. The most recent TimeLock Period in which stake was timeLocked. (called `lockedAt`)
///
/// Each user has exactly one instance of this timeLock struct, which manages all of
/// their timeLocked stake. This data structure is defined in `IStructs.TimeLock`.
/// This data structure was designed to fit into one word of storage, as a gas optimization.
/// Its fields are updated only when a user interacts with their stake.
/// ------------------------------------
///
/// -- TimeLocking Example --
/// In the example below, the user executes a series of actions on their stake (`Action`) during `TimeLock Period` N.
/// The fields of the user's timeLocked struct (`lockedAt`, `total`, `pending`) are illustrated exactly as
/// they would be represented in storage.
/// The field `un-TimeLocked` is the amount of un-TimeLocked stake, as represented *in storage*; however, because
/// state is only updated when the user interacts with their stake, this field may lag.
/// The field `un-TimeLocked (virtual)` is the true amount of un-TimeLocked stake, as represented in the system;
/// the value in this field represents stake that has moved from the state
/// "Deactivated & TimeLocke" to "Deactivated & Withdrawable" (see MixinStake).
