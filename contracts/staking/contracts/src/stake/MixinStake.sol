/// @dev This mixin contains logic for managing ZRX tokens and Stake.
/// Stake is minted when ZRX is deposited and burned when ZRX is withdrawn.
/// Stake can exist in one of many states:
/// 1. Activated
/// 2. Activated & Delegated
/// 3. Deactivated & TimeLocked
/// 4. Deactivated & Withdrawable
///
/// -- State Definitions --
/// Activated Stake
///     Stake in this state can be used as a utility within the 0x ecosystem.
///     For example, it carries weight when computing fee-based rewards (see MixinExchangeFees).
///     In the future, it may be used to participate in the 0x governance system.
///
/// Activated & Delegated Stake
///     Stake in this state also serves as a utility that is shared between the delegator and delegate.
///     For example, if delegated to a staking pool then it carries weight when computing fee-based rewards for
///     the staking pool; however, in this case, delegated stake carries less weight that regular stake (see MixinStakingPool).
///
/// Deactivated & TimeLocked Stake
///     Stake in this state cannot be used as a utility within the 0x ecosystem.
///     Stake is timeLocked when it moves out of activated states (Activated / Activated & Delagated).
///     By limiting the portability of stake, we mitigate undesirable behavior such as switching staking pools
///     in the middle of an epoch.
///
/// Deactivated & Withdrawable
///     Stake in this state cannot be used as a utility with in the 0x ecosystem.
///     This stake can, however, be burned and withdrawn as Zrx tokens.
