    /// @dev This mixin contains logic for staking pool rewards.
    /// Rewards for a pool are generated by their market makers trading on the 0x protocol (MixinStakingPool).
    /// The operator of a pool receives a fixed percentage of all rewards; generally, the operator is the
    /// sole market maker of a pool. The remaining rewards are divided among the members of a pool; each member
    /// gets an amount proportional to how much stake they have delegated to the pool.
    ///
    /// Note that members can freely join or leave a staking pool at any time, by delegating/undelegating their stake.
    /// Moreover, there is no limit to how many members a pool can have. To limit the state-updates needed to track member balances,
    /// we store only a single balance shared by all members. This state is updated every time a reward is paid to the pool - which
    /// is currently at the end of each epoch. Additionally, each member has an associated "Shadow Balance" which is updated only
    /// when a member delegates/undelegates stake to the pool, along with a "Total Shadow Balance" that represents the cumulative
    /// Shadow Balances of all members in a pool.
    /// 
    /// -- Member Balances --
    /// Terminology:
    ///     Real Balance - The reward balance in ETH of a member.
    ///     Total Real Balance - The sum total of reward balances in ETH across all members of a pool.
    ///     Shadow Balance - The realized reward balance of a member.
    ///     Total Shadow Balance - The sum total of realized reward balances across all members of a pool.
    /// How it works:
    /// 1. When a member delegates, their ownership of the pool increases; however, this new ownership applies
    ///    only to future rewards and must not change the rewards currently owned by other members. Thus, when a
    ///    member delegates stake, we *increase* their Shadow Balance and the Total Shadow Balance of the pool.
    ///
    /// 2. When a member withdraws a portion of their reward, their realized balance increases but their ownership
    ///    within the pool remains unchanged. Thus, we simultaneously *decrease* their Real Balance and 
    ///    *increase* their Shadow Balance by the amount withdrawn. The cumulative balance decrease and increase, respectively.
    ///
    /// 3. When a member undelegates, the portion of their reward that corresponds to that stake is also withdrawn. Thus,
    ///    their realized balance *increases* while their ownership of the pool *decreases*. To reflect this, we 
    ///    decrease their Shadow Balance, the Total Shadow Balance, their Real Balance, and the Total Real Balance.
