### Install Dependencies

If you don't have yarn workspaces enabled (Yarn < v1.0) - enable them:

```bash
yarn config set workspaces-experimental true
```

Then install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### Build

If this is your **first** time building this package, you must first build **all** packages within the monorepo. This is because packages that depend on other packages located inside this monorepo are symlinked when run from **within** the monorepo. This allows you to make changes across multiple packages without first publishing dependent packages to NPM. To build all packages, run the following from the monorepo root directory:

```bash
yarn lerna:rebuild
```

Or continuously rebuild on change:

```bash
yarn dev
```

You can also build this specific package by running the following from within its directory:

```bash
yarn build
```

or continuously rebuild on change:

```bash
yarn build:watch
```

### Clean

```bash
yarn clean
```

### Lint

```bash
yarn lint
```

### Run Tests

Before running the tests, you will need to spin up a [TestRPC](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereumjs-testrpc) instance.

In a separate terminal, start TestRPC (a convenience command is provided as part of the [0x.js monorepo](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo))

```bash
cd ../..
yarn testrpc
```

Then in your main terminal run

```bash
yarn test
```
