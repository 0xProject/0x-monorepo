## @0xproject/subproviders

A few useful web3 subproviders including a LedgerSubprovider useful for adding Ledger Nano S support.

We have written up a [Wiki](https://0xproject.com/wiki#Web3-Provider-Examples) article detailing some use cases of this subprovider package.

## Installation

```
yarn add @0xproject/subproviders
```

If your project is in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), add the following to your `tsconfig.json`:

```
"include": [
    "./node_modules/web3-typescript-typings/index.d.ts",
]
```

## Usage

Simply import the subprovider you are interested in using:

```javascript
import {
    ledgerEthereumBrowserClientFactoryAsync as ledgerEthereumClientFactoryAsync,
    LedgerSubprovider,
} from '@0xproject/subproviders';

const ledgerSubprovider = new LedgerSubprovider({
    networkId,
    ledgerEthereumClientFactoryAsync,
});

const accounts = await ledgerSubprovider.getAccountsAsync();
```

### Subproviders

#### Ledger Nano S subprovider

A subprovider that enables your dApp to send signing requests to a user's Ledger Nano S hardware wallet. These can be requests to sign transactions or messages.

Ledger Nano (and this library) by default uses a derivation path of `44'/60'/0'`. This is different to TestRPC which by default uses `m/44'/60'/0'/0`. This is a configuration option in the Ledger Subprovider package.

##### Ledger Nano S + Node-hid (usb)

By default, node-hid transport support is an optional dependency. This is due to the requirement of native usb developer packages on the host system. If these aren't installed the entire `npm install` fails. We also no longer export node-hid transport client factories. To re-create this see our integration tests or follow the example below:

```typescript
import Eth from '@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth';
import TransportNodeHid from '@ledgerhq/hw-transport-node-hid';
async function ledgerEthereumNodeJsClientFactoryAsync(): Promise<LedgerEthereumClient> {
    const ledgerConnection = await TransportNodeHid.create();
    const ledgerEthClient = new Eth(ledgerConnection);
    return ledgerEthClient;
}

// Create a LedgerSubprovider with the node-hid transport
ledgerSubprovider = new LedgerSubprovider({
    networkId,
    ledgerEthereumClientFactoryAsync: ledgerEthereumNodeJsClientFactoryAsync,
});
```

#### Redundant RPC subprovider

A subprovider which attempts to send an RPC call to a list of RPC endpoints sequentially, until one of them returns a successful response.

#### Injected Web3 subprovider

A subprovider that relays all signing related requests to a particular provider (in our case the provider injected onto the web page), while sending all other requests to a different provider (perhaps your own backing Ethereum node or Infura).

### Install Dependencies

If you don't have yarn workspaces enabled (Yarn < v1.0) - enable them:

```bash
yarn config set workspaces-experimental true
```

```bash
yarn install
```

### Build

```bash
yarn build
```

or

```bash
yarn build:watch
```

### Clean

```bash
yarn clean
```

### Lint

```bash
yarn lint
```

### Run tests

#### Unit tests

```bash
yarn run test:unit
```

#### Integration tests

In order to run the integration tests, make sure you have a Ledger Nano S available.

*   Setup your Ledger with the development mnemonic seed: `concert load couple harbor equip island argue ramp clarify fence smart topic`
*   Plug it into your computer
*   Unlock the device
*   Open the on-device Ethereum app
*   Make sure "browser support" and "contract data" are disabled
*   Start [TestRPC](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) locally at port `8545`

Then run:

```
yarn test:integration
```

**Note:** We assume a derivation path of `m/44'/60'/0'/0` which is already configured in the tests. With this setup and derivation path, your first account should be `0x5409ed021d9299bf6814279a6a1411a7e866a631`, exactly like TestRPC.

#### All tests

```bash
yarn run test:all
```
