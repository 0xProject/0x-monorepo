## v0.4.0 - _December 27, 2017_

    * Added custom 'underscore-privates' rule, requiring underscores to be prepended to private variable names
    * Because our tools can be used in both a TS and JS environment, we want to make the private methods of any public facing interface show up at the bottom of auto-complete lists. Additionally, we wanted to remain consistent with respect to our usage of underscores in order to enforce this rule with a linter rule, rather then manual code reviews.

    * Added rules for unused imports, variables and Async suffixes (#265)

## v0.1.0 - _November 13, 2017_

    * Re-published TsLintConfig previously published under NPM package `tslint-config-0xproject`
    * Updated to TSLint v5.8.0, requiring several rule additions to keep our conventions aligned.
