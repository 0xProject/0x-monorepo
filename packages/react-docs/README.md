## Installation

```bash
yarn add @0xproject/react-docs
```

## Usage

View the [live example](http://react-docs-example.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/) that renders the [@0xproject/web3-wrapper](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/development/packages/web3-wrapper) Typescript package. It's source code is in the [react-docs-example](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/development/packages/react-docs-example) 0x monorepo subpackage.

This package exposes both a single `Documentation` react component that will render a docs page, as well as all of it's sub-components in case someone wants to build their own layout.

Currently this package still has some external dependencies outside of the `Documentation` component, so please start your project off by copying the [react-docs-example](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/development/packages/react-docs-example) directory and modifying it there. If you need changes in the [react-docs](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/development/packages/react-docs) package, fork the 0x monorepo, make the required changes and submit a PR. Until we merge it, you can have your project depend on your own custom fork.

## Future improvements

Feel free to contribute to these improvements!

*   Allow user to pass in styling for all major elements similar to [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/).
*   Allow user to define an alternative font and have it change everywhere.
*   Add source links to Solidity docs (currently unsupported by Doxity).
