# SRA Report

This tool allows you to generate reports that detail an endpoint's [standard relayer API HTTP specification](https://github.com/0xProject/standard-relayer-api/blob/master/http/v0.md) compliance. The tool will perform a [Postman collection](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/collections/creating_collections) run and either print a report to the console or save it to disk as a json file. SRA report can also output a Postman collection file and [Postman environment](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments) file in order to facilitate replication and debugging of collection runs using the [Postman native app](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/launching_postman/installation_and_updates).

The tool currently performs the following checks for each endpoint:

*   `application/json` Content-Type header validation
*   JSON schema validation
*   Correct filtering when a query paramater is provided (ex. when querying for a specific maker address, all orders returned have the same maker address that was provided by the query)

Features to come:

*   Correct sorting (ex. the `/orderbook` endpoint should return orders in order of price)
*   Tests for pagination
*   Tests for the `POST /order` endpoint
*   Tests for failure cases and errors

## Installation

## Example Usage

### Print report to console

```bash
sra-report --endpoint-url 'http://api.example.com'
```

### Save a report to disk

```bash
sra-report --endpoint-url 'http://api.example.com' --output 'path/to/report.json'
```

### Generate report for an endpoint that serves kovan testnet orders

```bash
sra-report --endpoint-url 'http://kovan.api.example.com' --network-id 42
```

### Write Postman collection and environment files for use in the Postman native app

```bash
sra-report --endpoint-url 'http://.api.example.com' --export-collection 'path/to/collection.json' --export-environment 'path/to/environment.json'
```

### Run the report using a custom environment

```bash
sra-report --endpoint-url 'http://.api.example.com' --environment 'path/to/custom/environment.json'
```

## Custom environments

When testing your standard relayer API endpoint in development, it may be useful to modify the Postman environment file generated by this tool such that specific query parameters are used during the collection run. For example, by default, this tool will grab the first order it can from the `/orders` endpoint and use properties from that order as query parameters for the rest of the run. Another example is the tool will default to the [WETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) and [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498) token contracts when querying some endpoints but you may want to specify these.

In order to provide a custom environment to the tool, perform the following steps:

1.  Export a Postman environment file using the tool: [example](#Write-Postman-collection-and-environment-files-for-use-in-the-Postman-native-app)
2.  Open the Postman environment file using your favorite text editor or in the Postman native app
3.  Modify the specific values you want
4.  Save the environment file and export it if using the Postman native app
5.  Run the tool and supply a path to your modified environment file: [example](#Run-the-report-using-a-custom-environment)
