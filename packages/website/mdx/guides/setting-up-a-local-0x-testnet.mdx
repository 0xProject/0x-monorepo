# Introduction

When building on 0x, it is very helpful to build against a local Ethereum network that has the 0x smart contract pre-deployed on it. This has several advantages:

- No need to spend real ETH or public testnet ETH
- Instant mining so you don't have to wait for your transactions to get included in a block
- No need to deploy the 0x contracts yourself

In order to make this process as easy as possible, we maintain a [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/0xorg/ganache-cli) which spins up a [Ganache node](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) (a fast Ethereum RPC client for testing and development) that ships with all the 0x smart contracts pre-deployed. 

# Setup

In order to use the testnet node, you must first make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed. Once it's installed, you can download the image:

```bash
docker pull 0xorg/ganache-cli:latest
```

Then start the testnet with:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8545:8545 0xorg/ganache-cli:latest
```

The testnet node's [Ethereum JSON-RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) interface will be exposed on port `8545`. You can test that the node is reachable by sending the following cURL request:

```
curl -X POST \
http://localhost:8545/ \
-d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",false],"id":1}'
```

Upon startup, the node prints out 10 Ethereum addresses and their corresponding private keys. These can be used to send Ethereum transactions to the 0x contracts (fills, cancels, etc...). The addresses and private keys can also be derived from the following mnemonic:

```
concert load couple harbor equip island argue ramp clarify fence smart topic
``` 

You can instantiate a Web3 provider for signing requests for these accounts using the [@0x/subproviders](https://0x.org/docs/tools/subproviders) package's [MnemonicWalletSubprovider](https://0x.org/docs/tools/subproviders#mnemonicwalletsubprovider). Alternatively, simply copy some of the private keys and use the [PrivateKeyWalletSubprovider](https://0x.org/docs/tools/subproviders#privatekeywalletsubprovider).

The first EOA generated by the supplied mnemonic (`0x5409ed021d9299bf6814279a6a1411a7e866a631`) has a starting balance of 1,000,000,000 ZRX and all 9 unlocked accounts have a balance of ~100 ETH.

You are now able to have your application interact with this testnet by configuring your Ethereum JSON-RPC endpoint to be: `http://localhost:8545`! If using [0x.js](https://0x.org/docs/tools/0x.js), this can be done as follows:

```typescript
import { RPCSubprovider, Web3ProviderEngine } from '0x.js';

const rpcSubprovider = new RPCSubprovider('http://localhost:8545');
const provider = new Web3ProviderEngine() 
provider.addProvider(rpcSubprovider);
provider.start();

// Then use the provider
const contractWrappers = new ContractWrappers(provider, {networkId: 50});
```

# Contract addresses

Find the deployed 0x contract addresses in the [0x Cheat Sheet](https://0x.org/docs/guides/0x-cheat-sheet) guide. 

## Dummy tokens for testing

In addition to the 0x contracts, the snapshot also contains some dummy tokens that can be used for testing. These tokens are all mintable. Below is an example of how to mint an ERC20 token using [0x.js](https://0x.org/docs/tools/0x.js):

```typescript
import { DummyERC20TokenContract } from '0x.js';

(() => {
  const dummyERC20TokenWrapper = new DummyERC20TokenContract('0x34d402f14d58e001d8efbe6585051bf9706aa064', provider);
  await dummyERC20TokenWrapper.mint.awaitTransactionSuccessAsync(new BigNumber(1000));
})()
```

This example mints 1000 _base units_ of the ERC20 token at `0x34d402f14d58e001d8efbe6585051bf9706aa064`.
