# Rewards

The severity of reported vulnerabilities will be graded according to the [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard). The following table will serve as a guideline for reward decisions:

| Critical (CVSS 9.0 - 10.0) | High (CVSS 7.0 - 8.9) | Medium (CVSS 4.0 - 6.9) | Low (CVSS 0.0 - 3.9) |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| $10,000 - $100,000         | $2,500 - $10,000      | $1,000 - $2,500         | $0 - $1,000          |

Please note that any rewards will ultimately be awarded at the discretion of ZeroEx Intl. All rewards will be paid out in ZRX.

### Areas of interest

The following are examples of types of vulnerabilities that are of interest:

-   Loss of assets
    -   A user loses assets in a way that they did not explicitly authorize (e.g an account is able to gain access to an `AssetProxy` and drain user funds).
    -   A user authorized a transaction or trade but spends more assets than normally expected (e.g an order is allowed to be over-filled).
-   Unintended contract state
    -   A user is able to update the state of a contract such that it is no longer useable (e.g permanently lock a mutex).
    -   Any assets get unexpectedly "stuck" in a contract with regular use of the contract's public methods.
-   Bypassing time locks
    -   The `AssetProxyOwner` is allowed to bypass the timelock for transactions where it is not explicitly allowed to do so.
    -   A user is allowed to bypass the `AssetProxyOwner`.
