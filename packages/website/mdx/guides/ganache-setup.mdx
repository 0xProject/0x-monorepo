In order to run 0x.js methods that interact with the Ethereum blockchain (i.e filling an order, checking a balance or setting an allowance) you need to point your Web3 Provider to an Ethereum node. Because of the ~12 second block times, during development it is best to use [Ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) a fast Ethereum RPC client made for testing and development.

# Install Ganache-cli locally

```
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

In order to run Ganache-cli with all the latest V2 0x protocol smart contracts available, you must first download [this Ganache-cli snapshot](http://ganache-snapshots.0x.org.s3.amazonaws.com/0x_ganache_snapshot-2.4.0.zip) and save it. Next unzip it's contents with:

```bash
unzip ./0x_ganache_snapshot-2.4.0.zip -d ./0x_ganache_snapshot
```

You can now start Ganache-cli as follows:

```bash
ganache-cli \
--networkId 50 \
-p 8545 \
--db ./0x_ganache_snapshot \
-m "concert load couple harbor equip island argue ramp clarify fence smart topic"
```

**Note:** The `--db` flag expects the filepath to where the DB snapshot folder is located on your machine.

Since we started Ganache-cli on port 8545, we can pass ZeroEx the following provider during instantiation:

```
const provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545');
```

0x.js will now communicate with Ganache-cli over HTTP.

To test that your setup is working, use this cURL request to fetch the byte-code for the Exchange contract:

```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8545/ \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getCode","params":["0x0b1ba0af832d7c05fd64161e0db78e85978e8082", "latest"],"id":1}'
```

If the result key does not return `0x0`, then the contract code was successfully returned.

The first EOA generated by the supplied mnemonic (`0x5409ed021d9299bf6814279a6a1411a7e866a631`) has a starting balance of 1,000,000,000 ZRX and all 9 unlocked accounts have a balance of ~100 ETH. The dummy tokens can be minted by any address by calling the respective contract methods ([ERC20](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/blob/69c7c03fb34b3f21f65c40b73baa21184a296fb2/contracts/erc20/contracts/test/DummyERC20Token.sol#L67) & [ERC721](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/blob/69c7c03fb34b3f21f65c40b73baa21184a296fb2/contracts/erc721/contracts/test/DummyERC721Token.sol#L47) method).
