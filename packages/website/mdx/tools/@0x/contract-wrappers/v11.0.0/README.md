### Documentation

Documentation for this package is generated by TypeDoc, using the Solidity source code for 0x contracts. Each contract corresponds to one global-level module, which contains relevant enums and interfaces for its events and structs. Most significantly, each module exports a class, `<ContractName>Contract`, e.g. `ExchangeContract`, which implements helper methods for all the functions defined in the corresponding contract.

A convention to note is that these contract-specific helper methods are defined as _object literals_, which are separated from methods in the generated documentation. Each contract method has a number of sub-methods, e.g. `sendTransactionAsync`, or `estimateGasAsync`, which are documented separately. This is an example of an expected method call signature: `exchangeContractInstance.fillOrder.sendTransactionAsync(...arguments)`.
