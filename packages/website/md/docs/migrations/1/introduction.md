Welcome to the [@0x/migrations](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/development/packages/migrations) documentation! This package is intended for developers who would like to deploy the 0x protocol system of smart contracts to a custom testnet. If you want to test against existing testnets, check out our pre-deployed [Ganache snapshot](https://0x.org/wiki#Ganache-Setup-Guide) or where 0x is already deployed on [popular testnets](https://0x.org/wiki#Deployed-Addresses).
