Welcome to the [json-schemas](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/development/packages/json-schemas) documentation! This package provides JSON schemas for validating 0x Protocol & Standard Relayer API data structures. It provides both the raw JSON schemas and a schema validator class to interact with them from a JS project.

If you are not using a Javascript-based language for your project, you can use a Javascript environment to render the JSON schemas within this package and use them together with a [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) implementation in your [language of choice](http://json-schema.org/implementations.html) (e.g Python, Haskell, Go, C, C++, Rust, Ruby, Scala, etc...).
