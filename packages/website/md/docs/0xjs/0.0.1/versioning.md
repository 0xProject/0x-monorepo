This project adheres to the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) specification. The library's public interface includes all the methods, properties and types included in the documentation. Since the library is still an alpha, it's public interface is not yet stable and we will introduce backward incompatible changes to the interface without incrementing the major version until the `1.0.0` release. Our convention until then will be to increment the minor version whenever we introduce backward incompatible changes to the public interface, and to increment the patch version otherwise. This way, it is safe for you to include 0x.js in your projects with the tilda (e.g `~0.22.0`) without fear that a patch update would break your app.
