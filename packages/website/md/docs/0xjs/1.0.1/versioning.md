Since v1.0.0, this package adheres to the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) specification. The library's public interface includes all the methods, properties and types included in the documentation. We will publish with a major version bump for any breaking change to the public interface, use a minor version bump when introducing new features in a backwards-compatible way, and patch versions when introducing backwards-compatible bug fixes. Because of this, we recommend you import `0x.js` with a caret `^1.0.0` to take advantage of non-breaking bug fixes.
