                    <div>
                        In the two years since the Ethereum blockchain’s genesis block, numerous decentralized
                        applications (dApps) have created Ethereum smart contracts for peer-to-peer exchange. Rapid
                        iteration and a lack of best practices have left the blockchain scattered with proprietary and
                        application-specific implementations. As a result, end users are exposed to numerous smart
                        contracts of varying quality and security, with unique configuration processes and learning
                        curves, all of which implement the same functionality. This approach imposes unnecessary costs
                        on the network by fragmenting end users according to the particular dApp each user happens to be
                        using, eliminating valuable network effects around liquidity. 0x is the solution to this problem
                        by acting as modular, unopinionated building blocks that may be assembled and reconfigured.

                                0x is decentralized and trustless; there is no central party which can be hacked, run
                                away with customer funds or be subjected to government regulations. Hacks of Mt. Gox,
                                Shapeshift and Bitfinex have demonstrated that these types of systemic risks are

                                Rather than a proprietary system that exists to extract rent for its owners, 0x is
                                public infrastructure that is funded by a globally distributed community of
                                stakeholders. While the protocol is free to use, it enables for-profit user-facing
                                exchange applications to be built on top of the protocol.

                        0x protocol uses off-chain order books to massively reduce friction costs for market makers and
                        ensure that the blockchain is only used for trade settlement. Hosting and maintaining an
                        off-chain order book is a service; to incent “Relayers” to provide this service they must be
                        able to charge transaction fees on trading activity. Relayers are free to set their transaction
                        fees to any value they desire. We expect Relayers to be highly competitive and transaction fees
                        to approach an efficient economic equilibrium over time.

                        <div>
                            Participants in a state channel pass cryptographically signed messages back and forth,
                            accumulating intermediate state changes without publishing them to the canonical chain until
                            the channel is closed. State channels are ideal for “bar tab” applications where numerous
                            intermediate state changes may be accumulated off-chain before being settled by a final
                            on-chain transaction (i.e. day trading, poker, turn-based games).

                                While state channels drastically reduce the number of on-chain transactions for specific
                                use cases, numerous on-chain transactions and a security deposit are required to open
                                and safely close a state channel making them less efficient than 0x for executing
                                one-time trades.

                                State channels are isolated from the Ethereum blockchain meaning that they cannot
                                interact with smart contracts. 0x is designed to be integrated directly into smart
                                contracts so trades can be executed programmatically in a single line of Solidity code.

                        by 2020, thousands of assets will be tokenized and moved onto the Ethereum blockchain including
                        traditional securities such as equities, bonds and derivatives, fiat currencies and scarce

                answer: (
                    <div>
                        Ethereum and Bitcoin are both open source protocols. Each protocol has been forked, but the
                        resulting clone networks have seen little adoption (as measured by transaction count or market
                        cap). This is because users have little to no incentive to switch over to a clone network if the
                        original has initial network effects and a talented developer team behind it. An exception is in
                        the case that a protocol includes a controversial feature such as a method of rent extraction or
                        a monetary policy that favors one group of users over another (Zcash developer subsidy - for
                        better or worse - resulted in Zclassic). Perceived inequality can provide a strong enough
                        incentive that users will fork the original protocol’s codebase and spin up a new network that
                        eliminates the controversial feature. In the case of 0x, there is no rent extraction and no
                        users are given special permissions. 0x protocol is upgradable. Cutting-edge technical
                        capabilities can be integrated into 0x via decentralized governance (see section below),
                        eliminating incentives to fork off of the original protocol and sacrifice the network effects
                        surrounding liquidity that result from the shared protocol and settlement layer.

                                orders, respectively) to pay transaction fees to Relayers (entities that host and
                                maintain public order books).

                                ZRX tokens are used for decentralized governance over 0x protocol’s update mechanism
                                which allows its underlying smart contracts to be replaced and improved over time. An
                                update mechanism is needed because 0x is built upon Ethereum’s rapidly evolving
                                technology stack, decentralized governance is needed because 0x protocol’s smart
                                contracts will have access to user funds and numerous dApps will need to plug into 0x
                                smart contracts. Decentralized governance ensures that this update process is secure and
                                minimizes disruption to the network.

                        0x protocol’s decentralized update mechanism is analogous to proof-of-stake. To maximize the

                        Ultimately the solution will maximize security while also maximizing the protocol’s ability to

                                using funds raised through the token launch. If 0x protocol proves to be as foundational
                                a technology as we believe it to be, the retained ZRX tokens will allow the 0x core
                                development team to sustain operations beyond the first 5 years.
