{"openapi":"3.0.0","info":{"version":"2.0.0","title":"Standard Relayer REST API","description":"# Testing\n\nUse the [sra-report](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/development/packages/sra-report) command line tool to test your API for SRA compliance.\n\n# Schemas\n\nThe [JSON schemas](http://json-schema.org/) for the API payloads and responses can be found in [@0xproject/json-schemas](https://github.com/0xProject/0x.js/tree/development/packages/json-schemas). Examples of each payload and response can be found in the library's [test suite](https://github.com/0xProject/0x.js/blob/development/packages/json-schemas/test/schema_test.ts#L1).\n\n```bash\nnpm install @0xproject/json-schemas --save\n```\n\nYou can easily validate your API's payloads and responses using the [@0xproject/json-schemas](https://github.com/0xProject/0x.js/tree/development/packages/json-schemas) package:\n\n```js\nimport {SchemaValidator, ValidatorResult, schemas} from '@0xproject/json-schemas';\n\nconst {relayerApiTokenPairsResponseSchema} = schemas;\nconst validator = new SchemaValidator();\n\nconst tokenPairsResponse = {\n    ...\n};\nconst validatorResult: ValidatorResult = validator.validate(tokenPairsResponse, relayerApiTokenPairsResponseSchema);\n```\n\n# Pagination\n\nRequests that return potentially large collections should respond to the **?page** and **?perPage** parameters. For example:\n\n```bash\n$ curl https://api.example-relayer.com/v2/asset_pairs?page=3&perPage=20\n```\n\nPage numbering should be 1-indexed, not 0-indexed. If a query provides an unreasonable (ie. too high) `perPage` value, the response can return a validation error as specified in the [errors section](#section/Errors). If the query specifies a `page` that does not exist (ie. there are not enough `records`), the response should just return an empty `records` array.\n\nAll endpoints that are paginated should return a `total`, `page`, `perPage` and a `records` value in the top level of the collection. The value of `total` should be the total number of records for a given query, whereas `records` should be an array representing the response to the query for that page. `page` and `perPage`, are the same values that were specified in the request. See the note in [miscellaneous](#section/Misc.) about formatting `snake_case` vs. `lowerCamelCase`.\n\nThese requests include the [`/v2/asset_pairs`](#operation/getAssetPairs), [`/v2/orders`](#operation/getOrders), [`/v2/fee_recipients`](#operation/getFeeRecipients) and [`/v2/orderbook`](#operation/getOrderbook) endpoints.\n\n# Network Id\n\nAll requests should be able to specify a **?networkId** query param for all supported networks. For example:\n\n```bash\n$ curl https://api.example-relayer.com/v2/asset_pairs?networkId=1\n```\n\nIf the query param is not provided, it should default to **1** (mainnet).\n\nNetworks and their Ids:\n\n| Network Id | Network Name |\n| ---------- | ------------ |\n| 1          | Mainnet      |\n| 42         | Kovan        |\n| 3          | Ropsten      |\n| 4          | Rinkeby      |\n\nIf a certain network is not supported, the response should **400** as specified in the [error response](#section/Errors) section. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"code\": 100,\n    \"reason\": \"Validation failed\",\n    \"validationErrors\": [\n        {\n            \"field\": \"networkId\",\n            \"code\": 1006,\n            \"reason\": \"Network id 42 is not supported\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n# Link Header\n\nA [Link Header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) can be included in a response to provide clients with more context about paging\nFor example:\n\n```bash\nLink: <https://api.example-relayer.com/v2/asset_pairs?page=3&perPage=20>; rel=\"next\",\n<https://api.github.com/user/repos?page=10&perPage=20>; rel=\"last\"\n```\n\nThis `Link` response header contains one or more Hypermedia link relations.\n\nThe possible `rel` values are:\n\n| Name  | Description                                                   |\n| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| next  | The link relation for the immediate next page of results.     |\n| last  | The link relation for the last page of results.               |\n| first | The link relation for the first page of results.              |\n| prev  | The link relation for the immediate previous page of results. |\n\n# Rate Limits\n\nRate limit guidance for clients can be optionally returned in the response headers:\n\n| Header Name           | Description                                                                  |\n| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| X-RateLimit-Limit     | The maximum number of requests you're permitted to make per hour.            |\n| X-RateLimit-Remaining | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.           |\n| X-RateLimit-Reset     | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -i https://api.example-relayer.com/v2/asset_pairs\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Mon, 20 Oct 2017 12:30:06 GMT\nStatus: 200 OK\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 60\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 56\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1372700873\n```\n\nWhen a rate limit is exceeded, a status of **429 Too Many Requests** should be returned.\n\n# Errors\n\nUnless the spec defines otherwise, errors to bad requests should respond with HTTP 4xx or status codes.\n\n## Common error codes\n\n| Code | Reason                                  |\n| ---- | --------------------------------------- |\n| 400  | Bad Request – Invalid request format    |\n| 404  | Not found                               |\n| 429  | Too many requests - Rate limit exceeded |\n| 500  | Internal Server Error                   |\n| 501  | Not Implemented                         |\n\n## Error reporting format\n\nFor all **400** responses, see the [error response schema](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/blob/development/packages/json-schemas/schemas/relayer_api_error_response_schema.ts#L1).\n\n```json\n{\n    \"code\": 101,\n    \"reason\": \"Validation failed\",\n    \"validationErrors\": [\n        {\n            \"field\": \"maker\",\n            \"code\": 1002,\n            \"reason\": \"Invalid address\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nGeneral error codes:\n\n```bash\n100 - Validation Failed\n101 - Malformed JSON\n102 - Order submission disabled\n103 - Throttled\n```\n\nValidation error codes:\n\n```bash\n1000 - Required field\n1001 - Incorrect format\n1002 - Invalid address\n1003 - Address not supported\n1004 - Value out of range\n1005 - Invalid signature or hash\n1006 - Unsupported option\n```\n\n# Asset Data Encoding\n\nAs we now support multiple [token transfer proxies](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/master/v2/v2-specification.md#assetproxy), the identifier of which proxy to use for the token transfer must be encoded, along with the token information. Each proxy in 0x v2 has a unique identifier. If you're using 0x.js there will be helper methods for this [encoding](https://0xproject.com/docs/0x.js#zeroEx-encodeERC20AssetData) and [decoding](https://0xproject.com/docs/0x.js#zeroEx-decodeAssetProxyId).\n\nThe identifier for the Proxy uses a similar scheme to [ABI function selectors](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI#function-selector).\n\n```js\n// ERC20 Proxy ID  0xf47261b0\nbytes4(keccak256('ERC20Token(address)'));\n// ERC721 Proxy ID 0x08e937fa\nbytes4(keccak256('ERC721Token(address,uint256)'));\n```\n\nAsset data is encoded using [ABI encoding](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html).\n\nFor example, encoding the ERC20 token contract (address: 0x1dc4c1cefef38a777b15aa20260a54e584b16c48) using the ERC20 Transfer Proxy (id: 0xf47261b0) would be:\n\n```bash\n0xf47261b00000000000000000000000001dc4c1cefef38a777b15aa20260a54e584b16c48\n```\n\nEncoding the ERC721 token contract (address: `0x371b13d97f4bf77d724e78c16b7dc74099f40e84`), token id (id: `99`, which hex encoded is `0x63`) and the ERC721 Transfer Proxy (id: 0x08e937fa) would be:\n\n```bash\n0x08e937fa000000000000000000000000371b13d97f4bf77d724e78c16b7dc74099f40e840000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000063\n```\n\nFor more information see [the Asset Proxy](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-protocol-specification/blob/master/v2/v2-specification.md#erc20proxy) section of the v2 spec and the [Ethereum ABI Spec](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html).\n\n# Meta Data in Order Responses\n\nIn v2 of the standard relayer API we added the `metaData` field. It is meant to provide a standard place for relayers to put optional, custom or non-standard fields that may of interest to the consumer of the API.\n\nA good example of such a field is `remainingTakerAssetAmount`, which is a convenience field that communicates how much of a 0x order is potentially left to be filled. Unlike the other fields in a 0x order, it is not guaranteed to be correct as it is derived from whatever mechanism the implementer (ie. the relayer) is using. While convenient for prototyping and low stakes situations, we recommend validating the value of the field by checking the state of the blockchain yourself, such as by using [Order Watcher](https://0xproject.com/wiki#0x-OrderWatcher).\n\n# Misc.\n\n*   All requests and responses should be of **application/json** content type\n*   All token amounts are sent in amounts of the smallest level of precision (base units). (e.g if a token has 18 decimal places, selling 1 token would show up as selling `'1000000000000000000'` units by this API).\n*   All addresses are sent as lower-case (non-checksummed) Ethereum addresses with the `0x` prefix.\n*   All parameters are to be written in `lowerCamelCase`.\n","license":{"name":"Apache 2.0","url":"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html"}},"paths":{"/v2/asset_pairs":{"get":{"description":"Retrieves a list of available asset pairs and the information required to trade them (in any order).

Within the price sorted orders, the orders are further sorted by _taker fee price_ which is defined as the **takerFee** divided by **takerTokenAmount**. After _taker fee price_, orders are to be sorted by expiration in ascending order.
